# Caesar Cipher Encryption in C#

This is a simple C# program that demonstrates the Caesar cipher encryption technique. The Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher, is one of the oldest and simplest encryption methods.

## How it works

The program takes user input for a text message and a numeric key (shift value). It then encrypts the message using the Caesar cipher and displays the encrypted result.

The encryption process involves:

- Converting the input text to uppercase to simplify encryption.
- Iterating through each character in the input text.
- Encrypting letters by shifting them in the alphabet by the specified key.
- Preserving characters that are not letters (e.g., spaces or punctuation).

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the text and the encryption key.
5. The program will display the encrypted result.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

Enter the text to encrypt:
Hello, World!
Enter the key (shift value):
3
ASCII Encryption: KHOOR, ZRUOG!
